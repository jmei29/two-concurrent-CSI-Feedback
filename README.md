# Requirements
To implement this project, you need to ensure the following requirements are installed.
 * Matlab >= 2021b
 * Python = 3.8 or 3.9, please refere to [Versions of Python Compatible with MATLAB Products by Release](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html)
 * Pytorch >= 1.2

# Project Preparation

## Channel generation
The channel state information (CSI) matrix is generated from COST2100 model. You can generate your own dataset according to the open source library of [COST2100](https://github.com/cost2100/cost2100) as well. The details of data pre-processing can be found in our paper.
